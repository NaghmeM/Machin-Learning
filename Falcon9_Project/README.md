# **Project Background**
SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket has revolutionized the aerospace industry with its ability to successfully land reusable first stages, enabling significant cost savings and increased mission frequency. However, predicting the precise landing location of the Falcon 9 remains a complex challenge due to the dynamic nature of the flight trajectory and the influence of various environmental factors.

Accurately forecasting the landing location is crucial for several reasons:

Recovery Operations: Precise landing predictions facilitate efficient recovery operations, allowing SpaceX teams to quickly locate and retrieve the landed rocket stage for refurbishment and reuse.

Public Safety: Predicting landing locations is essential for ensuring public safety, as it allows for the timely evacuation of areas potentially affected by the rocket's descent and potential debris.

Mission Planning: Accurate landing predictions inform mission planning decisions, enabling SpaceX to optimize future launch trajectories and landing site selection.

This project aims to address the challenge of predicting Falcon 9 landing locations by developing a machine learning model capable of accurately forecasting landing coordinates based on historical flight data and real-time telemetry information. The project will involve collecting, processing, and analyzing a vast dataset of Falcon 9 flight data to identify patterns and relationships that can be exploited for predictive modeling.

The successful development of a reliable landing prediction model will contribute to the advancement of SpaceX's reusable rocket technology, enhancing mission efficiency, safety, and planning capabilities. Moreover, the project's findings can potentially be applied to other aerospace applications, improving the overall precision and predictability of rocket launches and landings. 
# **Data Collection Methods**
Space-X launch date gathered from Space-X Rest API (this data gives information about launchs, including information about the rocket, payload mass, launch specification, and landing outcome) https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API
and another way is webscraping from wikipedia Falcon9 web
# **Perform Data**

# **Result**
LR, SVM and Dicission Tree have the same result
